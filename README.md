# DipsacalesHybSeq
Dipscales hybrid-sequencing project using targeted enrichment of 353 low-copy nuclear loci in the [Angiosperms353 bait kit](https://arborbiosci.com/genomics/targeted-sequencing/mybaits/mybaits-expert/mybaits-expert-angiosperms-353/) designed by [Johnson _et al._ (2019)](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/68/4/594/5237557). All work in this repository is associated with 

> Lee, Aaron K., I. S. Gilman, M. Srivastav, A. Lerner, M. J. Donoghue, W. L. Clement. (*Accepted*) **Reconstructing Dipsacales phylogeny using Angiosperms353: Issues and insights**. American Journal of Botany.

## Using this repo
In this repository you'll find all scripts and notebooks for reproducing the results presented in Lee _et al._ (####), as well the most of the outputs (including alignments, gene and species trees, and figures). Notebooks are statistical analyses and self contained, and if they give you a "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" error, try copying and pasting the information in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org. Most other analyses (e.g., alignment, tree inference, and divergence time estimation) were completed on clusters at Yale University and The College of New Jersey, and can be walked through in detail in the [Wiki](https://github.com/aaklee/DipsacalesHybSeq/wiki).
