# off-target chloroplast data

We tried different alignment strategies and data partitions. MAFFT and MAFFT merge function were used to align, RAxML was used to reconstruct trees.
- "clade" = entire plastomes aligned; partition and align taxa by clade, merge alignments across clades
- "global" = entire plastomes aligned; all taxa aligned at once
- "combined" = genic and intergenic regions aligned individually, concatenated together; all taxa aligned at once
- "genic" = only genic regions; all taxa aligned at once
- "intergenic" = only intergenic regions; all taxa aligned at once
