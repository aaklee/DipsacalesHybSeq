#alignments and gene trees for ASTRAL and RAxML analyses\n
EO = exon-only\n
EF = exon + flanking region\n

- individual gene trees and locus alignments are zipped in tar.gz files
- concatenated gene trees (for ASTRAL analysis) and locus alignments (for RAxML analysis) are in single files
- partitions for concatenated locus alignments are in "_partitions.txt" files
- locus alignment statistics are in "_stats.txt" files were generated from AMAS v1
